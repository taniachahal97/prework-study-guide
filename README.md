# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This web application was developed to help bootcamp students to add and review all their learning during the pre-work. 
It will enable students to consolidate all their notes at one place which they can refer anytime as they progress through their bootcamp journey 
While developing this application we learnt various coding languages that are used extensively in web developement such as HTML, CSS,, and JavaScript.
